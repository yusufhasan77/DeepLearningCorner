# DeepLearningCorner
====================

This repository is created to demonstrate the skills learned in the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization by deeplearning.ai.

The repository is still a work in progress.

## Contents
===========

The repository will have following implementations :-

1. A fully connected feed forward neural network for classification of fashion mnist dataset
2. A convolutinal neural network for the classification of fashion mnist dataset
3. Neural style transfer
4. Object detection
4. Recurrent neural networks for character generation
5. Sentiment analysis

And possibly more.

Facial recognition was taught in the deep learning specialization but won't be including in this repository due to ethical reasons.
